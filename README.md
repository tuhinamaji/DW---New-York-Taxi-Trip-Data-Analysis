This project aims to build a data warehouse for analyzing taxi service data. The primary goal is to understand taxi service usage patterns, including high-demand zones, peak times throughout the year and other factors affecting the total revenue like tip amount. This analysis will enable taxi drivers to optimize their services, improve customer satisfaction, and increase profitability.
